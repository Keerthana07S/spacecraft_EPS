# Spacecraft EPS Simulation

This is a simulation of a spacecraft electrical power system (EPS). My intentions behind programming this simulation is to eventually use the IV curves generated for 
prediction of faults or soft errors. Over the following months, I will update this repository with code for an extended kalman filter (EKF), as well as a theoretical idea of
how to output fault estimations through quantum markov chains (QMCMC).
